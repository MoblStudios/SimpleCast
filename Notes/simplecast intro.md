# SimpleCast
A simple weather app for all devices. 

## Use case:
For people who only want to know 2 main things: What's the weather like now, and what will it be like for the next week.

A lot of apps handle the first one well, but very few handle the others.  I want to pull this out in the morning and see how the day will be, or to pull it out when planning and get a sense of which day to plan a hike.

## pitfalls other apps make:
Biggest one: the forecast is difficult to grok in a few seconds.
They fall into 2 groups:  look amazingly shitty, like local news levels of shitty.  or they don't /do/ anything, like sun.

## Features:
- *1-day forecast* What's happening today!
- *7 day forecast* The rest of the week.
- *main indicators* high, low and rain chance.
- *optional indicators* wind, cloud cover, moon light/phase?
- *location* it is cached so it can get the data as soon as possible.

## Other weather apps like ours:
http://pattern.dk/sun/ - free, does a good job showing the current weather, but no forecast.  Shows multiple cities.
